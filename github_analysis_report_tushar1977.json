    "experience_level_classification": {
      "level": "Mid-Level",
      "evidence": "Account age (2706 days) and number of repositories (58) suggest several years of experience. The variety of projects (OS, web development, scripting) indicates a breadth of knowledge. 'Senior' designation in summary is not fully supported by code quality indicators and collaboration metrics. Project Maintenance is 24% and community engagement is 36%.",
       "reasoning": "While the user profile indicates several years of activity, the code quality indicators (license usage, documentation) and limited collaboration metrics suggest a mid-level developer. The OS projects and the video streaming platform demonstrate competence beyond a junior level."
